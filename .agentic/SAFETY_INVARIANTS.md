# Safety Invariants

> **PARTIAL — seeded by hand from the owner's own statements in `README.md`,
> nothing inferred.** The Architect + Security stages still own this file and
> must extend it from the PRD/UX before any delivery stage runs. A missing
> invariant is not a permission.
>
> Each invariant: one line, testable, stated as what MUST hold across releases.

## Posting

- **INV-1** — Nothing is written to GitHub (issue comment, Discussion reply,
  or any other write) unless a person approved that specific reply first, and
  the approval is recorded. There is no code path that posts without one.
  *(README: "It never posts on its own: every reply is approved by a person
  first.")*

## Grounding

- **INV-2** — Every answer is drawn from Aveto's own documentation, and every
  drafted reply names the passages it came from.
  *(README: answers "from Aveto's own documentation"; step 3 drafts "a grounded
  reply".)*
- **INV-3** — A draft is checked against its sources by a different model from
  the one that wrote it; a claim the sources do not support is removed or the
  question is escalated — never posted as-is.
  *(README, step 4. Applies once drafting exists.)*
