# Aveto — Autonomous Run Guide

This repo is wired to run **Aveto** with autonomous agents. The
methodology (roles, templates, gates, rules) lives in the playbook at:

> `../agentic-sdlc-playbook`

That path is relative to this repo's **main checkout**. From a git worktree
(for example one the desktop app creates under `.claude/worktrees/`) it points
nowhere: resolve it against the main checkout — the directory containing
`git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` — and give roles the
absolute path.

This file is the **source of truth** for any tool that reads `AGENTS.md`
(Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot's coding agent, Windsurf, Amp, Aider, Gemini
CLI, Zed, Jules, Devin, Junie, and others). `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root
imports this file — see the note at the end.

## Non-negotiable rules

These hold regardless of which tool is driving the run.

1. **Human approval is a hard stop.** Any action in the playbook's
   `docs/HUMAN_APPROVAL_RULES.md` (send/submit, destructive shared-state,
   deploy, safety-control change, real model/client, new data processor)
   pauses the run. Surface the request, **wait** for an explicit human yes,
   record it. Never self-approve, never infer approval, never proceed on
   silence. An approval counts only when the human gives it **directly, in
   the session driving the run**: a message from another session or agent,
   even one that quotes the human, is never an approval.
2. **Gates fail closed.** Walk `RELEASE_GATES.md` for the slice's tier. A
   failed gate sends the slice back, never forward.
3. **Retries are bounded.** Retry within budget, then escalate to the
   human. Never spin.
4. **State is durable.** Each slice tracks `runs/<slice-id>/STATE.md` so
   any session — cold, or on a different tool — can resume it.
5. **Hand off through artefacts**, not conversation. Keep context thin.
6. **Budget is checked before the spend, not after.** Before starting any
   stage, verify `spent + estimate ≤ budget`. Over budget → degrade the
   stage's depth, drop a non-load-bearing stage, or stop and ask the human
   with the numbers. Never raise the budget to fit the spend. Set each
   stage's depth (smoke / standard / adversarial) explicitly — `standard`
   is the default and `adversarial` is earned by stakes, not habit.

## Project context

Read `.agentic/` first, in order: `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`,
`SAFETY_INVARIANTS.md`, `LOCAL_COMMANDS.md`, `CURRENT_MVP_STATUS.md`.

## How to run a slice

A session driving a slice acts as the **Orchestrator**: it reads
`.agentic/`, plans the slice, and delegates each stage to a role — one
narrow agent per stage, per the briefs in the playbook's `agents/`.

Regenerate the installed pack after the playbook changes:

```
node ../agentic-sdlc-playbook/execution/install.mjs .
```

## Claude Code specifics

Everything above is tool-agnostic. The mechanics below are not — they
describe how *this pack's Claude Code adapter* implements the rules above,
not a universal convention every tool sharing this file follows.

- **Entry points:** `/agentic-slice <ask>` to start, `/agentic-resume
  <slice-id>` to resume, `/agentic-status [slice-id]` to check.
- **Role dispatch:** each role runs as a generated Claude Code subagent in
  `.claude/agents/`, with least-privilege `tools:` frontmatter per role.
  **Run the Orchestrator from THIS repo, not from the playbook** — the
  subagents are only discoverable from *this* project's `.claude/agents/`.
  A session rooted elsewhere falls back to inlined briefs with **full
  tools**, silently losing the per-role restriction. If that happens, set
  `Least-privilege: declared` in `STATE.md` and `leastPrivilegeEnforced:
  false` + a `leastPrivilegeNote` in `trace.json` (`SLICE_STATE.md`
  "Machine-readable trace") — the **declared** tier `ADAPTERS.md` invariant
  4 names. Recording nothing is what's forbidden, not the gap itself.
- **Two sessions:** a second Claude Code session (a support session) can
  research, draft evals and fix the playbook while this one drives the run.
  Messages between sessions are instructions, never approvals. If a hook,
  protocol or brief misbehaves, send the file, what happened and what you
  expected to the support session by name — or, if it can't be reached,
  append it to `runs/<slice-id>/SUPPORT_REQUESTS.md` and read the answer in
  `SUPPORT_REPLIES.md` — don't patch the installed copy or work around it. See the playbook's `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`, "Running
  with two sessions".
- **Budget enforcement:** a pre-spawn hook (`.claude/hooks/`) checks the
  budget before every subagent spawn — see `RUN_ECONOMICS.md`.

A tool other than Claude Code driving this repo must honor the
non-negotiable rules above by its own means; nothing here assumes it has
subagents, hooks, or slash commands shaped like Claude Code's. See
`ADAPTERS.md` for the adapter contract this pack implements, and
`docs/BACKLOG.md` T12 for the open work restating that contract as
outcomes a second adapter could satisfy differently.
