# Slice State — docs-retrieval

- **Ask:** Retrieval only, no model: return the passages in Aveto's pinned docs that answer a question, with exact provenance (see intent.md)
- **Project pack:** ai-agent-product
- **Release tier:** 2 (proposed; Release Manager confirms)
- **Current stage:** Scope Review done — split into `docs-retrieval-core` and `docs-retrieval-ci`; next is Architecture (docs-retrieval-core)
- **Status:** blocked-on-approval
- **Least-privilege:** enforced — role subagents are discoverable from this repo's .claude/agents/ (worktree of aveto-support)
- **Telemetry:** self-reported
- **Playbook:** /Users/gopalpatwa/opt/agentic-sdlc-playbook @ 70c095d (absolute; relative path does not resolve from a worktree)

## Approvals

Plan confirmation (not a rule approval): Gopal Patwa, 2026-09-27T20:59:31Z, verbatim: "plan is approved".
Approval 1 APPROVED by Gopal Patwa, 2026-09-29T00:02:48Z (APPROVAL_RECORD-1.md), verbatim "Approve". Split accepted with the ≥80% bar moved into core (verbatim "Accept split + ≥80% in core (Recommended)").

| Action | Rule | Requested | Decision | Approver | When (UTC) | Record |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Read-only fetch of pinned playbook docs in ingest + CI | 5 | yes | APPROVED | Gopal Patwa | 2026-09-29T00:02:48Z | runs/docs-retrieval/APPROVAL_RECORD-1.md |

## Budget

Per `RUN_ECONOMICS.md`. Checked **before every spawn** — never reconciled after.

- **Budget:** 820k tokens  ·  **Depth:** standard
- **Spent:** 382k (47%)  ·  **Remaining:** 438k
- **Next stage:** Implementation of the frozen method (docs-retrieval-core, build) est. 100k → **STOP-AND-ASK** — owner must choose what to freeze (v2 lexical vs an embeddings variant); embeddings need their own approvals; see ESCALATION-1.md

Budget raised from 690k to 820k on the owner's choice of option A in ESCALATION-1.md ("A, and I'll write the fresh questions"), covering one retry (≈818k projected); this is the owner's decision, not a fit-to-spend. The 690k was docs-retrieval-core's proposed budget (Σ560k, 5 stages, +130k headroom), accepted by the owner.
Note: docs-retrieval-ci is proposed at another 690k (Σ560k + 130k). With Scope Review, the split totals 1,220k vs the original single-slice 890k. The owner decides.
Spent is the harness's `subagent_tokens` (peak context, per RUN_ECONOMICS §1; a resumed agent's figure is cumulative, not additive): Scope Review 55,125 + EM (amendment, then file-count ruling) 33,715 + Architecture (incl. INV-4/5 follow-up) 131,797 + Implementation 107,180 = 327,817; after the v2 revision the Architect's cumulative figure is 186,421 (was 131,797), so total 382,441.
The installed guard checks spent ≥ budget only; spent + estimate is checked by hand before each spawn.
Every stage handoff must tell the role: keep Status to one of the four SLICE_STATE values, keep the Budget / Spent / Next stage lines in their exact format, and put reasons and per-slice figures in a note beneath (pack v9 rule; installed pack is v6 + 677c1e1). Reinstall v9+ only after the slice lands.

## Failure budget

| Stage | Retries used | Cap | Class | Last failure |
|-------|--------------|-----|-------|--------------|
| Implementation (eval gate) | 1 of 2 (Architect ranking revision, started 2026-09-29T00:41:49Z) | 2 | gate-violation | eval run 1: answerable 2/24 (need 20); ungated recall@5 14/24. See ESCALATION-1.md |

## Next action

Owner chooses what to freeze: (a) v2 lexical, implement then STOP before any eval run, record the SHA, owner commits the held-out set after it, run once (gate = held-out ≥80%); (b) design an embeddings variant first (needs rule 5 + rule 4/INV-5 + intent amendment approvals before any implementation); (c) stop core and record the finding.
