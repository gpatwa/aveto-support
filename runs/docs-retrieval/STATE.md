# Slice State — docs-retrieval

- **Ask:** Retrieval only, no model: return the passages in Aveto's pinned docs that answer a question, with exact provenance (see intent.md)
- **Project pack:** ai-agent-product
- **Release tier:** 2 (proposed; Release Manager confirms)
- **Current stage:** Scope Review
- **Status:** in-progress
- **Least-privilege:** enforced — role subagents are discoverable from this repo's .claude/agents/ (worktree of aveto-support)
- **Telemetry:** self-reported
- **Playbook:** /Users/gopalpatwa/opt/agentic-sdlc-playbook @ 70c095d (absolute; relative path does not resolve from a worktree)
- **Started:** 2026-09-27T02:29:54Z  ·  **Updated:** 2026-09-27T20:59:31Z

## Approvals

Plan confirmation (not a rule approval): Gopal Patwa, 2026-09-27T20:59:31Z, verbatim: "plan is approved".
Approval 1 is PENDING and gates **Implementation**, per the confirmed plan; Scope Review and Architecture do not depend on it.

| Action | Rule | Requested | Decision | Approver | When (UTC) | Record |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Read-only fetch of pinned playbook docs in ingest + CI | 5 | yes | PENDING | — | — | runs/docs-retrieval/APPROVAL_REQUEST-1.md |

## Budget

Per `RUN_ECONOMICS.md`. Checked **before every spawn** — never reconciled after.

- **Budget:** 890k tokens  ·  **Depth:** standard
- **Spent:** 0k (0%)  ·  **Remaining:** 890k
- **Next stage:** Scope Review (review) est. 100k → **PROCEED** (0k + 100k ≤ 890k; checked by hand, installed guard lacks the estimate check)

Spend counts subagent stages only; the Orchestrator's own Intake is not metered.
Σ estimates (760k, stage 8a dropped) exceed the ~600k "slice too big" signal — Scope Review decides on a split first.

## Failure budget

| Stage | Retries used | Cap | Class | Last failure |
|-------|--------------|-----|-------|--------------|
| — | 0 | 2 | — | — |

## Interruptions

| Stage | Cause | Class | Partial artefact reached | Resumed |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------------------|---------|

## Trace

| Stage | Model | Effort | Start (UTC) | End (UTC) | Wall | Tokens | Tool calls | Retry # |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Total** | | | | | | 0 | 0 | |

## Next action

Engineering Manager runs Scope Review (decide split: 890k > ~600k signal). APPROVAL_REQUEST-1 must be answered before Implementation.
