# Slice State — docs-retrieval

- **Ask:** Retrieval only, no model: return the passages in Aveto's pinned docs that answer a question, with exact provenance (see intent.md)
- **Project pack:** ai-agent-product
- **Release tier:** 2 (proposed; Release Manager confirms)
- **Current stage:** Scope Review done — split into `docs-retrieval-core` and `docs-retrieval-ci`; next is Architecture (docs-retrieval-core)
- **Status:** in-progress
- **Least-privilege:** enforced — role subagents are discoverable from this repo's .claude/agents/ (worktree of aveto-support)
- **Telemetry:** self-reported
- **Playbook:** /Users/gopalpatwa/opt/agentic-sdlc-playbook @ 70c095d (absolute; relative path does not resolve from a worktree)
- **Started:** 2026-09-27T02:29:54Z  ·  **Updated:** 2026-09-29T00:19:07Z

## Approvals

Plan confirmation (not a rule approval): Gopal Patwa, 2026-09-27T20:59:31Z, verbatim: "plan is approved".
Approval 1 APPROVED by Gopal Patwa, 2026-09-29T00:02:48Z (APPROVAL_RECORD-1.md), verbatim "Approve". Split accepted with the ≥80% bar moved into core (verbatim "Accept split + ≥80% in core (Recommended)").

| Action | Rule | Requested | Decision | Approver | When (UTC) | Record |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Read-only fetch of pinned playbook docs in ingest + CI | 5 | yes | APPROVED | Gopal Patwa | 2026-09-29T00:02:48Z | runs/docs-retrieval/APPROVAL_RECORD-1.md |

## Budget

Per `RUN_ECONOMICS.md`. Checked **before every spawn** — never reconciled after.

- **Budget:** 690k tokens  ·  **Depth:** standard
- **Spent:** 221k (32%)  ·  **Remaining:** 469k
- **Next stage:** Implementation (docs-retrieval-core, build) est. 130k → **PROCEED** (221k + 130k = 351k ≤ 690k)

The 690k above is docs-retrieval-core's proposed budget (Σ560k, 5 stages, +130k headroom), accepted by the owner.
Note: docs-retrieval-ci is proposed at another 690k (Σ560k + 130k). With Scope Review, the split totals 1,220k vs the original single-slice 890k. The owner decides.
Spent is the harness's `subagent_tokens` (peak context, per RUN_ECONOMICS §1; a resumed agent's figure is cumulative, not additive): Scope Review 55,125 + EM (amendment, then file-count ruling) 33,715 + Architecture (incl. INV-4/5 follow-up) 131,797 = 220,637.
The installed guard checks spent ≥ budget only; spent + estimate is checked by hand before each spawn.
Every stage handoff must tell the role: keep Status to one of the four SLICE_STATE values, keep the Budget / Spent / Next stage lines in their exact format, and put reasons and per-slice figures in a note beneath (pack v9 rule; installed pack is v6 + 677c1e1). Reinstall v9+ only after the slice lands.

## Next action

backend-architect implements docs-retrieval-core exactly as 02-tech-spec.md specifies (18 files, EM-accepted). Then QA Evidence.
