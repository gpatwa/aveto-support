## Next action

Stage 4 done at the checkpoint (commit 2). Spawn stage 5 (Frontend Developer): make the 6 failing tests in tests/test_page_cards.py pass (file frozen; read 04-implementation.md "Notes for stage 5" first), write suggestions.toml and T-Q, update test_service_pages.py line 67. Rule on the deviations listed in 04-implementation.md (none is a stop in the Backend Architect's reading).
